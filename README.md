# Overview of the Analysis 
The purpose of this project is to use Jupyter notebook, Python, Pandas, and MatPlotLib in order to produce a variety of charts that will help PyBer improve access to their ride sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

## Summary & Recommendations 
1. In order to increase profits, PyBer should continue to invest in increasing the number of riders in urban cities since that is where the majority of the company's profits come from. This is shown in the multiple-line graph. 
2. In order to make rides more affordable, PyBer should increase the number of drivers in rural cities. However, the high average fare per ride could also be because rural cities require rides of greater distances. 
3. In order to match demand, PyBer should decrease the number of drivers in urban cities unless the number of riders increases. While urban cities only have 13 times more total rides than rural cities, they have 30.83 times more total drivers.
